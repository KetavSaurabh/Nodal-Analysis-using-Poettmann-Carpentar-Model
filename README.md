# Poettmann-Carpentar Model for Nodal Analysis

## Description
This project implements the Poettmann-Carpenter model for nodal analysis, using a dataset obtained from a published research paper.
The aim is to optimise the tubing size for optimum production rate which is determined by the Inflow Performance Curve and Outflow Performance Curve.

## Motivation/Objective
- The project was undertaken as part of my Petroleum Engineering studies to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical scenario, and to gain a deeper understanding of Nodal Analysis.
- The project was also my first brush with Data Analytics in real life.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Optimum tubing size prediction model for vertical multiphase flow during flow production period of oil wells

## Installation
- Python 3.x.x (Mine is 3.12.2)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook file "Nodal Analysis (Poettmann-Carpenter Method).ipynb" and execute the cells. This will load the dataset, apply the Poettmann-Carpenter model, and visualize the results.

## Results
Key findings of the project include optimized production rates and insights into reservoir-wellbore interactions. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Theory
A detailed explanation of the Poettmann-Carpenter model and its application in nodal analysis is provided within the Jupyter Notebook. Please refer to the source research paper as well as the notebook for an in-depth theoretical background.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements or suggestions.
